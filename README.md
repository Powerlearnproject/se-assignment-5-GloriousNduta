10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

Initializing a Git Repository
Open VS Code:

Launch Visual Studio Code and open your project folder or create a new one.
Initialize Git Repository:

Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+``).
Navigate to your project directory using the terminal.
Run the following command to initialize a new Git repository:
csharp
Copy code
git init
Making Commits
Stage Changes:

Make changes to your files (e.g., modify existing files or create new ones).
Open the Source Control view in VS Code by clicking on the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side (or press Ctrl+Shift+G).
You will see a list of changed files. Click the + button next to each file you want to stage, or use the Stage All Changes button (+ icon) at the top to stage all changes.
Commit Changes:

After staging your changes, enter a commit message in the text box at the top of the Source Control view.
Press Ctrl+Enter or click the checkmark icon (✔️) to commit your changes.
Pushing Changes to GitHub
Create a Repository on GitHub (if not already created):

Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
Click on the + icon in the top-right corner and select New repository.
Follow the instructions to create a new repository, optionally initializing it with a README file.
Set the Remote Repository:

In VS Code, copy the HTTPS or SSH URL of your GitHub repository.
In the integrated terminal, add the remote repository URL as follows (replace <remote-url> with your GitHub repository URL):
csharp
Copy code
git remote add origin <remote-url>
Push Commits to GitHub:

After staging and committing your changes locally, push them to the remote GitHub repository.
In the integrated terminal, use the following command to push your changes to the main branch (or another branch if you specify):
css
Copy code
git push -u origin main
If it's your first time pushing to this repository, you may need to authenticate with GitHub using your username and password or token.
Key Features and Tips
Source Control View: Use this view in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+G) to manage your Git operations, including staging changes, committing, and comparing changes.
Branching and Merging: Explore branching (git checkout -b <branch-name>) and merging (git merge <branch-name>) to manage multiple streams of work.
Visual Diffing: VS Code provides visual tools for comparing file changes (Changes tab in the Source Control view) and resolving merge conflicts.
Example Workflow

Initialize Repository:

Open VS Code, navigate to your project folder, and initialize Git using git init in the integrated terminal.
Make Changes:

Modify files within your project folder.
Stage and Commit:

Stage changes using the Source Control view in VS Code.
Commit changes with a descriptive message.
Push to GitHub:

Set the remote repository URL (git remote add origin <remote-url>).
Push your commits to GitHub (git push -u origin main)
